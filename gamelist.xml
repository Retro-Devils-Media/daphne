    <desc>GP World was produced by Sega in 1984. In this laserdisc racing game, you have the choice between one of the three circuits proposed to compete with computer-controlled racing cars.
It is a rather average game in the realization where it is difficult to feel the feeling of speed despite the projection of the real circuits filmed as scenery.
But it is moving away from the traditional laserdisc spirit, interactive cartoons and shoot&apos;em up, which changes a bit.</desc>

    <desc>Space Ace is a laserdisc video game produced by Don Bluth Studios, Cinematronics and Advanced Microcomputer Systems (later renamed RDI Video Systems). It was unveiled in October 1983, just four months after the Dragon&apos;s Lair game, then released in Spring 1984, and like its predecessor featured film-quality animation played back from a laserdisc.

The gameplay is also similar, requiring the player to move the joystick or press the fire button at key moments in the animated sequences to govern the hero&apos;s actions. However, the game&apos;s action was more varied with the player occasionally given the temporary option to either have the character he is controlling transform back into his adult form, or remain as a boy with different styles of challenges.</desc>

    <desc>The idea for this animated laserdisc game comes from the movies and novels about Don Quixote, the legendary Spanish knight. In this game, the character looks very young and does not have a mustache. Also, he has a sword for a weapon and his faithful sidekick Sancho Panza follows him around although he does nothing to assist the hero.
An assortment of mythical creatures including demons, dragons, skeletons and so on are encountered throughout the game. The game ends when Don Quixote kills the evil witch and rescues Isabella.</desc>

Linz), a ring and sends Cale on one of the evacuation ships with his alien friend, Tek (Tone Loc). Meanwhile, Sam and other members of his team fly the Titan spacecraft from Earth and into Hyperspace.

    <desc>They are among us, who? Invaders, aliens or aliens, in short, little green guys! Obviously to make a game they must be bad and want to take possession of our beautiful planet, otherwise it&apos;s not funny. As you have guessed, freedom lies on your shoulders and depends on your accuracy in shooting and acrobatics.
Us vs. Them is an aerial shoot game with a rather classic and unpretentious realization where your ship is more or less inlaid in a background animated by videos. To make the interludes more dynamic, scenes with real actors punctuate the story in a spirit close to the TV series of the 80s. The game will appeal to lovers of science fiction, shoot and low budget TV series. Others will more readily turn to titles like M.A.C.H. 3.</desc>
